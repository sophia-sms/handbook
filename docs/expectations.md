# Expectations

There are 2 Music Technology courses:

- Music Technology
- Advanced Music Technology

There are 3 groups of students in these courses:

- Experienced program students
- New program students
- Elective students

Because there is a range of backgrounds and abilities in both courses, the course content will be similar with differing expectations of student performance.

- Both program and elective students can be in either course.
- In general, students in Advanced Music Technology have completed Music Techonology (though it's possible to be in Advanced without having taken Music Technology).
- _Experienced_ program students will be expected to demonstrate a higher level of creativity and execution.
- _New_ program students and elective students will be expected to complete the assignments to the best of their abilities.
- The mix of students provides an opportunity for everyone to collaborate and learn from each other — with positive feedback.
- _Experienced_ program students will "learn by teaching" through acting as mentors for the _New_ program students and elective students.
- _New_ program students and elective students should not hesitate to ask questions of the instructor or the experienced program students and share their work. It's through sharing our work and getting feedback that we grow and improve.
