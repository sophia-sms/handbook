# Course Outline

CFPA Music Technology consists of 4 practice areas:

- Composition
- Recording & Production
- Performance
- Live Sound

The course will be centered around projects that will give students the opportunity to both experience a taste of each of these areas and focus on the ones they're interested in.

## Overview

- Students will complete at least two projects per marking period.
- The last marking period will be dedicatd to End-of-Year and Senior Exit Projects.
- Each class will produce a live show together, probably around the end of the second marking period.
    - Program students have additional performance requirements; this live show is a separate class-based project that will involve all students in each class.
